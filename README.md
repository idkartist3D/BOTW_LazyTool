# BOTW_LazyTool
This is a simple tool designed to simplify the process of making BOTW mods
It handles all the small things, like renaming, backing up, encoding/decoding multiple files, and using the command line.
## Dependencies
All these programs must be in the same directory as this tool to work properly.
* [Yaz0Dec.exe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/163993370635665409/359538263733698583/Yaz0dec.rar)
* [Yaz0Enc.exe](http://amnoid.de/gc/yaz0enc.zip)
* [BFRES_Vertex.py](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6132)
* [BOTW-AutoMips.py](https://github.com/CEObrainz/Botw-AutoMipping)
## Usage
Using the tool is as simple as draging and dropping files onto it.
* Drop in a .bfres file and a .csv file to run them through BFRES_Vertex, BOTW-AutoMips, and Yaz0Enc
* Drop in any number of .sbfres or .bfres files to automatically run them through Yaz0Dec or Yaz0Enc and to rename them
* Drop in any number of .sbitemico or sbitemico.bfres files to automatically run them through Yaz0Dec or Yaz0Enc and to rename them
## Notes
~~While the tool automatically renames files, it also deletes any files that occupy that name.~~

Backing up old files is now supported! 

Always back up any importaint files, especially original files, in a safe place.
